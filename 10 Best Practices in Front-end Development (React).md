# **1. Use of Absolute Paths Instead of Relative Paths** 

When entering a new project, it's common to encounter paths filled with
"../../../../../." These paths are known as relative paths, and while
they are a way to import files, they are not the most recommended
approach. The ideal practice is to use absolute paths, which provide the
full path to a file. To implement this in your project, some
configurations are required, especially if you are using Webpack or
TypeScript.

### React App :

#### Using Path Aliases with Babel
1. Install babel-plugin-module-resolver:
```
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-module-resolver

```
2. Create a .babelrc file in your project's root:
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    [
      "module-resolver",
      {
        "root": ["./src"],
        "alias": {
          "@context": "./src/context",
          "@utils": "./src/utils"
          // Add more aliases as needed
        }
      }
    ]
  ]
}

```
3. Now you can use these aliases in your imports:
```js
import { useAuth } from '@context/authContext';
import { DDMMYY } from '@utils/dateUtils';

```

Setting up Webpack (create-react-app):

If you are using create-react-app, configuring absolute paths is
relatively straightforward. Start by creating a file in the root of your
project called "jsconfig.json" and add the following content:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src"
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

Setting up TypeScript:

If you're using TypeScript, add the following configurations to your
"tsconfig.json" file:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
      "@/*": ["src/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

By doing so, you can transform a code snippet that looks like this:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
import { Button } from '../../../../components/Button'
import { Icon } from '../../../../components/Icon'
import { Input } from '../../../../components/Input'
```

Into something cleaner and easier to read, like:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
import { Button } from '@/components/Button'
import { Icon } from '@/components/Icon'
import { Input } from '@/components/Input'
```

# **2. Using "Export Barrel" for Module Organization** 

While looking at the code mentioned earlier, I recalled a technique that
can significantly enhance code readability and maintenance: the "export
barrel," also known as "re-export." This approach involves creating a
file called "index.js" (or "index.ts" if you are using TypeScript)
within a folder and, from this file, exporting all the modules present
in the folder.

To illustrate, imagine you have a folder named "components" with the
following files: "Button.tsx," "Icon.tsx," and "Input.tsx." With the
"export barrel" technique, you would create an "index.ts" file and fill
it as follows:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
export * from './Button'
export * from './Icon'
export * from './Input'
```

By doing this, when you want to use these components on a page or in
another module, you can import them all at once like this:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
import { Button, Icon, Input } from '@/components'
```

This practice simplifies code organization and improves maintenance
since it reduces the need to list each component individually. Moreover,
it makes the code cleaner and easier to understand, which is crucial in
medium to large-scale projects.

# **3. Choosing Between "Export Default" and "Named Export"** 

As we delve into the topic of the "export barrel," it's essential to
note that it can conflict with the use of "export default." If this is
not clear, I'll illustrate the situation with examples:

Let's go back to our components:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
export const Button = () => {
  return <button>Button</button>
}
export default Button
```

``` {.at .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
export const Icon = () => {
  return <svg>Icon</svg>
}
export default Icon
```

``` {.at .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
export const Input = () => {
  return <input />
}
export default Input
```

Imagine each of these components is in a separate file, and you want to
import all of them at once. If you are accustomed to default imports,
you might attempt something like:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
import Button from '@/components'
import Icon from '@/components'
import Input from '@/components'
```

However, this won't work because JavaScript can't determine which
"export default" to use, resulting in errors. You would be forced to do
something like this:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
import Button from '@/components/Button'
import Icon from '@/components/Icon'
import Input from '@/components/Input'
```

This, however, negates the advantage of the "export barrel." How can you
resolve this dilemma? The solution is simple: use "Named Export," which
is exporting without "default":

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
import { Button, Icon, Input } from '@/components'
```

Another critical issue associated with "export default" is the ability
to rename what you're importing. I'll share a real-life example from
early in my career. I inherited a React Native project where the
previous developer used "export default" for absolutely everything.
There were screens named "Login," "Register," and "ForgotPassword."
However, all three screens were copies of each other with minor
modifications. The problem was that, at the end of each screen file,
there was an "export default Login." This resulted in confusion, as the
route file imported correctly:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
import Login from '../../screens/Login'
import Register from '../../screens/Register'
import ForgotPassword from '../../screens/ForgotPassword'

// Further down, the usage in routes:

  {
    ResetPassword: { screen: ResetPassword },
    Login: { screen: LoginScreen },
    Register: { screen: RegisterScreen },
  }
```

But when opening the screen files, they all exported the same name:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
const login() {
  return <>tela de login</>
}
export default Login
```

``` {.at .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
const login() {
  return <>tela de registro</>
}
export default Login
```

``` {.at .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
const login() {
  return <>tela de esqueci minha senha</>
}
export default Login
```

This created a maintenance nightmare with constant confusion and the
need for extreme vigilance to avoid errors.

In summary, it's highly recommended to use "Named Export" in most cases
in your project and resort to "export default" only when strictly
necessary. There are situations, such as Next.js routes and React.lazy,
that may require the use of "export default." However, it's crucial to
strike a balance between code clarity and compliance with specific
requirements.

# **4. Proper File Naming Conventions** 

Let's imagine you have a components folder with the following files:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
--components:
----Button.tsx
----Icon.tsx
----Input.tsx
```

Now, suppose you want to separate styles, logic, or types of these
components into separate files. How would you name these files? An
obvious approach might be the following:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
--components:
----Button.tsx
----Button.styles.css
----Icon.tsx
----Icon.styles.css
----Input.tsx
----Input.styles.css
```

Certainly, this approach can seem somewhat disorganized and challenging
to understand, especially when you intend to further divide the
component into distinct files, such as logic or types. But how can you
keep the structure organized? Here's the solution:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
--components:
----Button
------index.ts (exports everything necessary)
------types.ts
------styles.css
------utils.ts
------component.tsx
----Icon
------index.ts (exports everything necessary)
------types.ts
------styles.css
------utils.ts
------component.tsx
----Input
------index.ts (exports everything necessary)
------types.ts
------styles.css
------utils.ts
------component.tsx
```

This approach makes it easy to identify the purpose of each file and
simplifies the search for what you need. Additionally, if you're using
Next.js or a similar framework, you can adapt the file naming to
indicate whether the component is intended for the client or server
side. For example:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
--components:
----RandomComponent
------index.ts (exports everything necessary)
------types.ts
------styles.css
------utils.ts
------component.tsx
----RandomComponent2
------index.ts (exports everything necessary)
------types.ts
------styles.css
------utils.ts
------component.server.tsx
```

This way, it becomes extremely simple to distinguish whether a component
is meant for the client or server side without the need to open the code
for verification. Organizing and standardizing file naming is essential
to maintain clarity and efficiency in development projects.

# **5. Proper Use of ESLint and Prettier for Code Standardization** 

Imagine yourself working on a project with over 10 colleagues, each
bringing their own coding style from past experiences. Here's where
ESLint and Prettier come into play. They play a crucial role in
maintaining code consistency throughout the team.

Prettier acts as a kind of "guardian" of code formatting, ensuring that
everyone adheres to the style guidelines set for the project. If the
project's standard dictates the use of double quotes, for example, you
can't simply opt for single quotes because Prettier will automatically
replace them. Furthermore, Prettier can perform various other fixes and
formatting, like code alignment, adding semicolons at the end of
statements, and more. You can check the specific Prettier rules in the
official documentation: Prettier Options.

ESLint, on the other hand, enforces specific rules on the code, helping
to maintain a cohesive and coherent codebase. For instance, it can
enforce the use of arrow functions over regular functions, ensure that
the React dependencies array is properly filled, prohibit the use of
"var" declarations in favor of "let" and "const," and apply naming
conventions like camelCase. You can find the specific ESLint rules in
the official documentation: ESLint Rules.

The combined use of ESLint and Prettier helps to maintain consistency in
source code. Without them, each developer can follow their own style,
which can lead to conflicts and maintenance difficulties in the future.
Having these tools set up is essential for the longevity of a project,
as it helps keep the code organized and easy to understand. If you're
not already using ESLint and Prettier, seriously consider incorporating
them into your workflow, as they will greatly benefit your team and your
project as a whole.

# **6. Husky and Lint-Staged: Reinforcing Code Standardization** 

If you are already familiar with ESLint and Prettier, you know that in
some situations, it's possible to circumvent the rules defined by these
tools. To ensure compliance with your established code guidelines and
avoid formatting issues, it's highly recommended to use Husky and
Lint-Staged.

These two tools play a vital role in your development workflow, allowing
you to set up ESLint and Prettier to run before making a commit. This
means you won't be able to commit unless the code is in compliance with
the rules you've set. You can also configure these tools to check the
code before pushing it to the repository.

Furthermore, Husky supports running other scripts or actions before a
commit or push, which broadens your possibilities to automate
verification tasks and ensure code quality.

Another advantage of Husky and Lint-Staged is their integration with
code hosting platforms like GitHub. This allows you to set up automated
testing and quality checks before accepting a pull request. This way,
you can ensure that the submitted code complies with your established
rules, minimizing issues and ensuring consistency.

These tools are essential to prevent developers from making commits with
evident issues and to ensure that the code is always aligned with the
established guidelines. The combination of ESLint, Prettier, Husky, and
Lint-Staged is a highly effective practice for maintaining code quality
and standardization in your project.

# 7. **Custom Hooks for Logic Reusability**

When working with React, it's common to use navigation hooks provided by
libraries like react-router-dom, Next.js, or react-navigation (for React
Native). However, these generic navigation hooks lack knowledge of the
specific pages in your application, which can lead to limitations. An
effective solution is to create custom navigation hooks that are aware
of all the pages in your application, making it easier to navigate
between them.

Here's an example of creating a custom navigation hook:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
import { useCallback } from 'react'
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom'
import type { Routes } from '@/types'

export const useRouter = () => {
  const navigate = useCallback((path: Routes) => goTo(path), [goTo])

  return { navigate }
}
```

There might be some initial resistance due to the apparent complexity of
abstracting a navigation hook. However, in the long run, this approach
offers several advantages. It simplifies calling the hook and provides
autocomplete for the function, making the code cleaner and easier to
understand. Moreover, it streamlines maintenance because if you need to
change the navigation library in the future, you'll only need to make
changes in the custom hook rather than everywhere the navigation hook is
used.

This same idea of creating custom hooks can be applied to other aspects
of your application, such as managing cookies, local storage
(localStorage), API calls, and more. This approach allows you to easily
reuse logic in multiple places in your project, promoting modularity and
simplified code maintenance.

# **8. The Difference Between Hooks and Utility Functions**

Understanding the distinction between creating a hook and a utility
function is crucial, although developers often confuse these two
concepts. To illustrate this difference, I'll share a practical example
that reflects a less experienced approach I used to take in my projects.

Inside the Hooks folder:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
export const useFormat = () => {
  const formatHour = (date: number) => {
    return new Date(date).toLocaleTimeString('pt', { timeStyle: 'short' })
  }
  // Other date/time formatting functions
  return { formatHour }
}
```

In this example, I created a hook that actually contains a utility
function. This approach is not the most efficient since a new hook is
created every time the component using it renders, which can impact
performance. Additionally, a hook is specific to a component and not
easily reusable in other contexts.

The correct approach would be to create a utility function in a
dedicated directory, such as "Utils":

Inside the Utils folder:

``` {.ai .aj .uz .va .vb .vc .vd .gy .fr .ha .ja .ax}
export const formatHour = (date: number) => {
  return new Date(date).toLocaleTimeString('pt', { timeStyle: 'short' })
}
```

In this case, the utility function is created only once and can be used
anywhere in your project, irrespective of the context. It is not tied to
a specific component and does not generate the overhead of creating
hooks with each rendering.

The fundamental distinction is that a hook is a component without a
visual part, created externally to React, and called within a specific
component, whereas a utility function is created only once outside the
React context and can be used anywhere. The choice between hooks and
utility functions should be based on the specific needs of your project
and code reuse considerations.

# **9. Using useCallback and useMemo for Performance Optimization** 

The distinction between using useCallback, useMemo, and not using them
can have a significant impact on performance optimization in React
applications. Essentially, useCallback is employed to memoize functions,
while useMemo is used to memoize values. Both serve the purpose of
preventing functions or values from being recreated with each component
rendering.

This is particularly important due to an intrinsic issue in React: the
frequent recreation of functions and values during rendering. While
React is efficient, this frequent recreation can lead to unnecessary
re-rendering of child components, potentially resulting in a performance
drop. It's essential to note that this occurs due to the way React is
designed, and it's not something easily changed.

The solution to this problem lies in the judicious use of useCallback
and useMemo. They allow you to avoid the frequent recreation of
functions and values, thereby enhancing your application's performance.
However, it's crucial to use them judiciously, as excessive use can have
the opposite effect and harm performance. Each use of useCallback or
useMemo involves two actions: one to create the function or value and
another to memoize it. Additionally, some functions or values may be
more efficient to recreate than to memoize.

If you are already familiar with this issue, you likely know how to use
useCallback and useMemo. However, it's important to exercise caution, as
excessive use can result in performance drops and even hard-to-trace
bugs (I guarantee you wouldn't want to deal with such bugs).

If you are unfamiliar with this issue, it's highly recommended to read
various articles on the subject, as it's a significant problem with the
potential to pose performance challenges and debugging difficulties in
React applications.

# **10. Logic Separation** 

In addition to considering the distinction between hooks and utility
functions, it's crucial to keep pages as simple as possible and separate
logic when feasible. By doing so, you can enhance the organization and
maintainability of your code. Here are some practices to consider:

Toast Logic: If a page needs to display toasts, it's a good idea to
create a separate component and a dedicated function for displaying
these toasts. This way, you keep the logic separate from the
presentation on the page.

API Calls: If a page makes API calls, consider using libraries like
React Query and keep the logic related to these calls in an external
hook. The page itself can then use this hook, keeping it cleaner and
focused on presentation.

Reusable Components: For components that are reusable across various
parts of your application, place them in a global components directory.
If organization becomes confusing this way, you can adopt a component
design pattern, such as Atomic Design. However, remember that software
development is dynamic, and new approaches may emerge at any time.
Evaluate the quality and effectiveness of these approaches for your
specific situation.

By following these code organization practices and adopting a mindset of
continuous learning, you can improve the quality and efficiency of your
work while making the code easier to understand and maintain. This, in
turn, will further enhance the value of your work as a developer.
