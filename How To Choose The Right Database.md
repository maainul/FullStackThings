# ERP ARCHITECURE AND TECH


Designing a large-scale ERP software for a company with 50,000 employees and handling 2,000,000 
transactions daily requires careful planning and architecture.


**Microservices** architecture is a good approach as it allows FOR : 
1. scalability, 
2. flexibility, and 
3. maintainability

Break down your ERP system into core modules based on **Functional** areas such as 

1. HR
2. Finance
3. Production
4. Inventory Management
5. Logistics
6. Procurement
7. Washing
8. MIS


Each core module should be developed as a **separate microservice**. 

## Technology Stack:

Choose appropriate technologies for each microservice. For example, use 

## Backend services

1. Java/Spring Boot, 
2. Node.js, or 
3. Python for . 
   
## Containerization and orchestration.   

1. Utilize Docker and Kubernetes

## Asynchronous communication between microservices
Use message queues like 
1. Kafka or 
2. RabbitMQ for 

## Database  
Employ relational or NoSQL databases based on the requirements of each module.

## Event-Driven Architecture: 
Utilize event-driven architecture for real-time processing of transactions and updates across modules.

## Scalability and Performance: 
Design the system to handle high volumes of transactions and concurrent users. Implement caching mechanisms, load balancing, and horizontal scaling to ensure optimal performance.

## Security: 
Implement robust authentication, authorization, and data encryption mechanisms to ensure data security and compliance with regulations such as GDPR.

## Monitoring and Logging: 
Implement monitoring and logging solutions to track system health, performance metrics, and detect anomalies or errors.

## Testing and Deployment: 
Implement automated testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines to ensure the reliability and agility of the system.


## Client and Server design : Should i use Single Client and Multiple Servers

**Single Client, Multiple Servers:**

In this approach, you would have a single client application (e.g., web application, mobile app) that communicates with multiple backend servers, each responsible for different modules (HR, Finance, Production, etc.).

**Advantages:**

1. Simplified client-side development: You have a unified user interface and client-side logic, reducing development effort and complexity.
2. Centralized client management: Updates and maintenance of the client application can be centralized.
3. Easy integration: Modules can share data and functionalities more seamlessly within a single application.

**Challenges:**

1. Increased complexity on the server-side: Managing multiple backend servers can be complex, especially if they have different technologies, databases, or APIs.
2. Scalability concerns: Scaling individual modules may be challenging as they are tightly coupled within a single application.
3. Dependency management: Changes in one module might impact others, leading to potential conflicts and dependencies.

**Multiple Clients, Multiple Servers:**

In this approach, you would develop separate client applications for each module, with each client communicating with its corresponding backend server.

**Advantages:**
1. Modular and scalable architecture: Each module can be independently developed, deployed, and scaled as needed.
Clear separation of concerns: Each client-server pair is responsible for a specific domain, reducing complexity and dependencies.
2. Technology flexibility: Different modules can be developed using technologies best suited for their requirements.

**Challenges:**

1. Increased client-side development effort: Developing and maintaining multiple client applications may require more effort and resources.
2. Consistency and user experience: Ensuring consistency in user experience across multiple applications can be challenging.
3. Integration complexity: Integrating data and functionalities across different client applications may require additional effort and coordination.


# So, I will Use Multiple Client and Multiple Server


## Questions : If you have a microservices architecture where different modules such as HR, Production, and MIS are implemented as separate microservices, you'll need a mechanism for communication between these services to fetch the required data and display it in the frontend.

**1. API Gateway:**

1. Implement an API gateway as a single entry point for client requests. The API gateway can handle authentication, routing, load balancing, and communication with different microservices.
2. Configure the API gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservice based on the requested data.

**2. Microservices Communication:**

3. Use HTTP-based communication protocols such as REST or GraphQL for communication between microservices.
4. Each microservice exposes a set of APIs to interact with its data and functionalities.
5. When a client request requires data from multiple microservices (e.g., HR, Production, MIS), the API gateway orchestrates the communication between these services.

**3. Data Aggregation and Composition:**

6. If a client request involves fetching data from multiple microservices, the API gateway can aggregate and compose the data before sending it back to the client.
7. Alternatively, the frontend application can make parallel requests to multiple microservices and combine the results on the client-side.

**4. Service-to-Service Communication:**

8.  Microservices may need to communicate with each other to fulfill client requests that span multiple domains.
9.  Use asynchronous messaging patterns such as message queues (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) or event-driven architectures to enable communication between microservices.
10. Events or messages can be emitted by one microservice and consumed by others to trigger actions or propagate data updates.

**5. Data Denormalization and Caching:**

11. Consider denormalizing data or using caching mechanisms to improve performance and reduce the need for frequent cross-service communication.
12. Cache frequently accessed data in a distributed cache or in-memory data store to minimize latency and improve scalability.

**6. Frontend Integration:**

## How can I do client to client navigation Efficeiently ?
Navigating between clients in a distributed system can indeed pose challenges, primarily due to the separation of concerns and potential performance overhead. However, you can design your system to facilitate smooth client-to-client navigation while addressing these challenges. Here's how:

Centralized Authentication and Authorization:

Implement a centralized authentication and authorization service (such as your RBAC service) that all clients can authenticate against.
Use standards like OAuth 2.0 or OpenID Connect for secure authentication and token-based authorization.
Once authenticated, clients can obtain access tokens that grant them permission to access other clients.
Single Sign-On (SSO):

Implement SSO to allow users to sign in once and access multiple clients seamlessly without needing to re-authenticate.
Use protocols like SAML or OAuth 2.0 for SSO authentication between clients.
API Gateway or Reverse Proxy:

Employ an API gateway or reverse proxy to provide a unified entry point for client requests and route them to the appropriate client.
The gateway can handle routing, load balancing, and SSL termination, simplifying client-to-client communication.
Service Discovery:

Utilize service discovery mechanisms to enable clients to discover and communicate with each other dynamically.
Use technologies like DNS-based service discovery or service registries (e.g., Consul, Eureka) to register and discover client services.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):

Configure CORS policies appropriately to allow cross-origin requests between clients.
Define CORS policies on servers to specify which origins are allowed to access resources.
Data Sharing and Integration:

Design APIs or data exchange mechanisms to facilitate seamless data sharing and integration between clients.
Use standardized data formats (e.g., JSON, XML) and RESTful principles for interoperability and ease of integration.
Asynchronous Communication:

Where possible, use asynchronous communication patterns (e.g., messaging queues, event-driven architecture) to decouple clients and reduce dependencies.
Implement publish-subscribe mechanisms to notify interested clients of relevant events or updates.
Load Balancing and Scalability:

Ensure that your infrastructure is horizontally scalable and can handle increased load and traffic as the number of clients grows.
Use load balancers and auto-scaling mechanisms to distribute requests evenly across client instances.
Security Considerations:

Implement appropriate security measures to protect client-to-client communication, including encryption, token validation, and data integrity checks.
Consider the sensitivity of the data being exchanged and implement security controls accordingly.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) 


Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a popular method for managing access to resources within a system. Implementing RBAC for authentication in your ERP software ensures that users only have access to the resources and functionalities relevant to their roles. Here's how you can incorporate RBAC into your authentication system:

**Define Roles:** Identify the different roles within your organization, such as admin, manager, employee, etc. Each role should have specific permissions associated with it.

**Assign Permissions:** Define the permissions required for each role. For example, an admin might have permissions to access and modify all modules, while an employee might only have permissions to view their own data.

**User-Role Mapping:** Associate each user with one or more roles based on their job responsibilities. This mapping determines the permissions granted to each user.

**Authentication Service:** Implement an authentication service responsible for validating user credentials and retrieving user roles and permissions from the database.

A**uthorization Middleware:** Create middleware or interceptor components that intercept requests to protected resources. These components check the user's role and permissions before allowing access to the requested resource.

**Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implement access control lists to define granular permissions for each resource or endpoint. This allows for fine-grained control over access to specific functionalities within the ERP system.

**Secure Authentication Mechanisms:** Use secure authentication mechanisms such as JWT (JSON Web Tokens), OAuth, or OpenID Connect to authenticate users and generate access tokens.

**Token-Based Authentication:** Issue access tokens containing user roles and permissions upon successful authentication. These tokens should be included in subsequent requests to authorize access to protected resources.

**Token Validation:** Implement token validation mechanisms to ensure that access tokens are valid, not expired, and have not been tampered with.

**Session Management:** Manage user sessions securely to track user authentication status and prevent unauthorized access.

**Role-Based UI Rendering:** Customize the user interface based on the user's role to display only the relevant functionalities and data.

**Audit Logging:** Implement audit logging to record all authentication and authorization events for accountability and compliance purposes.

Regular Review and Updates: Regularly review and update roles, permissions, and access control policies to align with changing business requirements and security best practices.
