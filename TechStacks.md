Load Balancing:

Load Balancers: Implement load balancers such as Nginx, HAProxy, or use cloud provider load balancers to distribute incoming traffic across your servers.
Dynamic Load Balancing: Utilize algorithms like round-robin, least connections, or weighted round-robin for efficient traffic distribution.
Health Checks: Configure health checks to monitor server health and automatically route traffic away from unhealthy servers.
Session Persistence: Ensure session persistence (sticky sessions) for maintaining session state between client requests.
Global Load Balancing: Implement global load balancing solutions for distributing traffic across multiple regions or data centers.
This comprehensive stack covers all the necessary components for building, testing, deploying, and monitoring a microservices-based application with load balancing.



Nginx:

Description: Nginx is a popular open-source web server and reverse proxy server. It's widely used as a load balancer due to its efficiency and flexibility.
Features: Nginx can distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers using various load balancing algorithms such as round-robin, least connections, and IP hash. It also supports health checks to monitor server availability and failover mechanisms.

Tutorial: Setting Up Nginx Load Balancing
HAProxy:

Description: HAProxy is a high-performance TCP/HTTP load balancer and proxy server. It's known for its reliability, advanced load balancing algorithms, and extensive feature set.
Features: HAProxy supports multiple load balancing algorithms, health checks, SSL termination, and layer 7 routing. It's widely used in high-traffic websites and applications.

AWS Elastic Load Balancer (ELB):

Description: AWS Elastic Load Balancer is a fully managed load balancing service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets (such as EC2 instances or containers) to ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
Features: ELB offers three types of load balancers: Application Load Balancer (ALB), Network Load Balancer (NLB), and Classic Load Balancer. Each type is optimized for specific use cases and provides features like health checks, SSL termination, and integration with other AWS services.
